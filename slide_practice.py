# Function Notation
# f(x) = 5x + 2
# x is considered our input, in the paranthesis f(x)
# Outputvalue woud be 5x + 2 calculated

# Functions (in Python): allow you to simplify
# a problem and/or reuse the same code. The action of 
# creating a function is known as "procedureal abstraction"
# This all helps you organize your code

# f(x) = 5x + 2 rewritten as a Python function
def f(x): 
	y = 5*x + 2
	return y

# Every function starts with "def"
# Every function has a colon to end the first line
# Most functions have parameters (input, our example, is x)
# Every function has a name (here, ours is f)
# All lines of code inside the function are indented

# Using a function ("calling" a function)
# Find the y value associated with f(x) when x = 10
# f(10) = 5(10) + 2 = 52
# If you want an answer from a function, store it

y = f(10)
# 10 is my parameter (input)
# This will pass 10 through the function and return a value
print(y)

y1 = f(1) # 7
y2 = f(2) # 12
y3 = f(3) # 17

# Functions must be defined BEFORE you call (use) them
# Usually functions go at the top of your program
# Examples of Functions

def example_1(x):
	ans = x ** x
	return ans

e2 = example_1(2) # = 4
e5 = example_1(5) # = 3125
print(e5 - e2) # = 3121

# Example of a fuction that cubes
def cube_it(x):
	ans = x * x * x
	return ans

cube_4 = cube_it(4)
print(cube_4) # = 64

# Examples of a function that averages your grades
# 60% for tests, 30% fpr quizzes, 10% for others
def grade(test_avg, quiz_avg, other_avg):
	# Three parameters (inputs)
	total = (.60 * test_avg) + (.30 * quiz_avg) + (.10 * other_avg)
	return total

# Predict Mr P's six weeks grade in English
